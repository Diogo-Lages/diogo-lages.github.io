## **Steps for the CTF**

### **1. Scanning for Ports**
The first step in any CTF is reconnaissance. I started by scanning the target machine for open ports using `nmap`, a popular port scanning tool.

```bash
nmap <TARGET_IP>
```

> **Note:** Replace `<TARGET_IP>` with the actual IP address provided on the TryHackMe platform.

The scan revealed two open ports:
- **SSH** on port 22
- **HTTP** on port 80

I also performed a full port scan using the `-p-` flag to ensure no other ports were open. However, only these two were accessible.

Since I didnâ€™t have any credentials for SSH, I focused on the HTTP service running on port 80.

---

### **2. Checking the Web**
When accessing the web server through the browser, I noticed something unusual in the URL:

```
http://<TARGET_IP>?page=home.html
```

The `page` parameter seemed to be loading `home.html`. This raised suspicions about potential vulnerabilities like **Local File Inclusion (LFI)**. LFI allows attackers to manipulate the `page` parameter to access sensitive files on the server.

#### **Exploiting LFI**
I attempted to exploit the LFI vulnerability by modifying the `page` parameter to include `/etc/passwd`. Unfortunately, this didnâ€™t work directly. After trying several payloads, I used a **PHP wrapper** to bypass restrictions:

```php
php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=/etc/passwd
```

This successfully returned the file but encoded in Base64. Using **CyberChef**, I decoded the file and discovered two users: `blue` and `red`.

#### **Further Enumeration**
I tried accessing other sensitive files such as:
- `/etc/shadow`
- `/home/blue/.ssh/id_rsa`
- `/home/red/.ssh/id_rsa`

However, none of these attempts yielded useful results. Eventually, I stumbled upon `/home/blue/.bash_history`, which contained valuable information.

---

### **3. Getting Access**
In the `.bash_history` file, I found a command that indicated `blue` was generating a wordlist using `hashcat`. The command referenced a "reminder" file, which likely contained the base password.

#### **Recreating the Wordlist**
Using the same `hashcat` command from the `.bash_history`, I recreated the wordlist on my local machine. To retrieve the contents of the "reminder" file, I again exploited the LFI vulnerability.

Once I had the wordlist, I used **Hydra**, a brute-forcing tool, to crack the SSH password for the `blue` user. Hydra can be configured with a graphical interface or via the command line.

```bash
hydra -l blue -P wordlist.txt ssh://<TARGET_IP>
```

After some time, Hydra successfully cracked the password. I then logged into the machine via SSH:

```bash
ssh blue@<TARGET_IP>
```

Inside, I found the first flag!

---

### **4. Privilege Escalation**
With initial access as `blue`, I moved on to escalate privileges. I uploaded **Pspy**, a tool for monitoring processes on Linux systems, to identify any suspicious activity.

#### **Monitoring Processes**
Using Pspy, I discovered a recurring command that attempted to establish a reverse shell to `redrules.thm` on port 9001. To intercept this connection, I added an entry to my `/etc/hosts` file:

```
<TARGET_IP> redrules.thm
```

Then, I set up a `netcat` listener on port 9001:

```bash
nc -lvnp 9001
```

After waiting patiently, I intercepted the reverse shell and gained access as the `red` user. This gave me the second flag.

---

### **5. Rooting the Machine**
Finally, it was time to escalate privileges to root. I began by stabilizing my shell to ensure better functionality:

```bash
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
export TERM=xterm
```

#### **Investigating SUID Binaries**
During enumeration, I discovered a custom version of `pkexec` located in `/home/red/.git/`. This binary had a known vulnerability that could be exploited to gain root access.

#### **Exploiting the Vulnerability**
I downloaded an exploit script written in Python and modified it to target the custom `pkexec` binary. Specifically, I updated the path to `/home/red/.git/pkexec`.

Running the exploit granted me a root shell:

```bash
./exploit.py
```

From there, I retrieved the final flag!

---

## **Conclusion**
This CTF taught me valuable lessons about:
- Identifying and exploiting Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerabilities
- Brute-forcing credentials using tools like Hydra
- Monitoring processes with Pspy
- Leveraging known exploits for privilege escalation

If you have any questions or need further clarification, feel free to leave a comment. Happy hacking! ðŸ”¥

### **Tips for Solvers**
- Always start with thorough reconnaissance using tools like `nmap`.
- Pay attention to unusual parameters in URLsâ€”they might indicate vulnerabilities.
- Use enumeration tools like `Pspy` to uncover hidden processes or scripts.
- Research known exploits for outdated binaries or services.
- Practice patience and persistenceâ€”CTFs often require multiple attempts to succeed.
