A GUI-based Python tool for crawling websites, managing proxies, respecting robots.txt rules, and exporting data in HTML, JSON, or CSV formats.

### Web Crawler Repository

## Features  

- **GUI Interface**: A user-friendly graphical interface for configuring and controlling the crawler.  
- **Robots.txt Compliance**: Automatically checks and respects website crawling rules defined in `robots.txt`.  
- **Proxy Management**: Supports proxy rotation to avoid IP blocking during large-scale crawls.  
- **URL Filtering**: Includes and excludes URLs based on customizable patterns and domain restrictions.  
- **Real-Time Statistics**: Displays live metrics such as pages crawled, memory usage, queue size, and errors.  
- **Data Visualization**: Provides dynamic graphs for crawl speed, memory usage, and URLs in the queue.  
- **Export Options**: Export crawled data in HTML, JSON, or CSV formats for further analysis.  
- **Pause/Resume/Stop**: Full control over the crawling process with pause, resume, and stop functionality.  
- **Concurrency**: Configurable number of concurrent workers for efficient crawling.

## How It Works  

The Enhanced Web Crawler is a Python-based desktop application designed to extract structured data from websites while adhering to ethical crawling practices. Here's how it works:  

1. **Input Configuration**:  
   - Enter the starting URL, maximum depth, and other settings like the number of concurrent workers and rate limits.  
   - Add include/exclude URL patterns to filter which pages should be crawled.  

2. **Crawling Process**:  
   - The tool checks `robots.txt` compliance before crawling any page.  
   - It uses proxies (if configured) to rotate IPs and avoid being blocked.  
   - URLs are processed concurrently using a thread pool, ensuring efficient crawling.  

3. **Data Extraction**:  
   - Extracts metadata such as page titles, links, and timestamps.  
   - Stores the crawled data in memory for real-time updates and visualization.  

4. **Monitoring and Export**:  
   - Real-time statistics and visualizations help monitor the crawling process.  
   - Once crawling is complete, export the results in HTML, JSON, or CSV formats for further analysis.

## Code Structure  

The project is organized into modular components for clarity and maintainability:  

- **`crawler/`**: Core functionality for crawling, proxy management, robots.txt parsing, and statistics tracking.  
  - `proxy_manager.py`: Manages proxy rotation.  
  - `robots.py`: Handles robots.txt compliance.  
  - `stats.py`: Tracks crawling statistics.  
  - `url_filter.py`: Filters URLs based on patterns and domains.  

- **`gui/`**: Implements the graphical user interface.  
  - `dashboard.py`: Displays real-time statistics and logs.  
  - `visualization.py`: Provides dynamic graphs for monitoring the crawl process.  

- **`webcrawler.py`**: Entry point of the application, initializes the GUI and starts the crawler.

## Future Enhancements  

- **Advanced Export Options**: Support additional export formats like XML or Excel.  
- **Improved Proxy Handling**: Add support for authenticated proxies and automatic proxy fetching.  
- **Database Integration**: Store crawled data directly in a database for large-scale projects.  
- **Enhanced Visualizations**: Add more detailed graphs and analytics for crawled data.  
- **Error Recovery**: Implement automatic retry mechanisms for failed requests.

## Ethical Considerations  

The Enhanced Web Crawler is designed with ethical considerations in mind:  

- **Respect for Robots.txt**: The tool automatically checks and adheres to `robots.txt` rules to ensure compliance with website policies.  
- **Rate Limiting**: Users can configure rate limits to avoid overloading servers with too many requests.  
- **Proxy Rotation**: Helps distribute requests across multiple IPs, reducing the risk of overwhelming a single server.  
- **Transparency**: Clear documentation ensures users understand how to use the tool responsibly.  

Always ensure that you have permission to crawl a website and that your actions comply with applicable laws and terms of service.
