### **Walkthrough**

#### **CTF Platform**: TryHackMe  
#### **Level**: Medium  

#### **Tools Used**:

- Wireshark  

#### **Resources Used:**: 

- Carnage: [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/room/c2carnage)
- VirusTotal
- Wireshark Documentation 



## **Steps for the CTF**

---

#### **1. What was the date and time for the first HTTP connection to the malicious IP?**
- Navigate to `View > Time Display Format > UTC Date and Time of Day` to set a human-readable timestamp format.
- Filter HTTP traffic using `http`.
- Use `Statistics > HTTP > Requests` to identify the malicious IP and locate the timestamp of the first HTTP connection.

---

#### **2. What is the name of the zip file that was downloaded?**
- Apply the filter: `http.host == "attirenepal.com"`.
- Analyze the HTTP requests and responses to locate the name of the downloaded zip file.

---

#### **3. What was the domain hosting the malicious zip file?**
- Apply the same filter: `http.host == "attirenepal.com"`.
- The domain name will be visible in the filtered packets.

---

#### **4. Without downloading the file, what is the name of the file in the zip file?**
- Follow the TCP stream for relevant traffic (e.g., `tcp.stream eq 73`).
- Look for references to the file name within the stream.

---

#### **5. What is the name of the webserver of the malicious IP from which the zip file was downloaded?**
- Search for the `.xls` file in the packet strings.
- Use `tcp.stream eq 73` to locate the webserver name in the HTTP headers.

---

#### **6. What is the version of the webserver from the previous question?**
- In the same TCP stream (`tcp.stream eq 73`), look for the `x-powered-by` header to identify the webserver version.

---

#### **7. Malicious files were downloaded to the victim host from multiple domains. What were the three domains involved with this activity?**
- Enable `View > Name Resolution > Resolve Network Addresses` to translate IPs into domain names.
- Analyze the traffic to identify the domains involved in downloading malicious files.

---

#### **8. Which certificate authority issued the SSL certificate to the first domain from the previous question?**
- Filter the traffic for the specific domain (e.g., `tcp.stream eq 90`).
- Look for the certificate details in the SSL/TLS handshake packets.

---

#### **9. What are the two IP addresses of the Cobalt Strike servers?**
- Go to `Statistics > Conversations > TCP Tab`.
- Look for patterns such as repeated packets of the same size.
- Verify suspected IPs using VirusTotal to confirm if they are Cobalt Strike servers.

---

#### **10. What is the Host header for the first Cobalt Strike IP address from the previous question?**
- Apply the filter: `ip.addr == <Cobalt Strike IP>`.
- Follow the TCP stream to locate the Host header.

---

#### **11. What is the domain name for the first IP address of the Cobalt Strike server?**
- With Name Resolution enabled, check the Source column for the domain name associated with the IP.
- Verify the domain using VirusTotal.

---

#### **12. What is the domain name of the second Cobalt Strike server IP?**
- Apply the filter: `ip.addr == <Second Cobalt Strike IP>`.
- Follow the TCP stream to locate the domain name.
- Verify the domain using VirusTotal.

---

#### **13. What is the domain name of the post-infection traffic?**
- Analyze the post-infection traffic for domain names.
- Look for suspicious domains in the HTTP or DNS traffic.

---

#### **14. What are the first eleven characters that the victim host sends out to the malicious domain involved in the post-infection traffic?**
- Analyze the TCP/HTTP stream for POST requests.
- Identify the first eleven characters of the data being sent.

---

#### **15. What was the length for the first packet sent out to the C2 server?**
- Locate the first packet sent to the C2 server.
- Check the packet details for its length.

---

#### **16. What was the Server header for the malicious domain from the previous question?**
- Analyze the HTTP stream for the Server header.
- Extract the value from the response headers.

---

#### **17. The malware used an API to check for the IP address of the victimâ€™s machine. What was the date and time when the DNS query for the IP check domain occurred?**
- Apply the filter: `dns && frame contains "api"`.
- Locate the DNS query packet and extract the timestamp.

---

#### **18. What was the domain in the DNS query from the previous question?**
- Use the same filter: `dns && frame contains "api"`.
- Extract the domain name from the DNS query.

---

#### **19. Looks like there was some malicious spam (malspam) activity going on. What was the first MAIL FROM address observed in the traffic?**
- Remove all filters and search for `MAIL FROM`.
- Locate the email address in the SMTP traffic.

---

#### **20. How many packets were observed for the SMTP traffic?**
- Go to `Statistics > Protocol Hierarchy`.
- Locate the SMTP protocol and note the number of packets.
