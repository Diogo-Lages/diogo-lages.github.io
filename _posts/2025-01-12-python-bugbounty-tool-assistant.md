A Python-based interactive CLI tool designed to assist bug bounty hunters and security testers by providing quick access to commands for Recon, Exploitation, and Miscellaneous tasks.

### Bug Bounty Tools Assistant Repository

- **Link**: [Bug Bounty Tools Assistant Repository](https://github.com/Diogo-Lages/Bug-Bounty-Tools-Assistant)

## Features
- **Interactive Menu**: Navigate through categories like Recon, Exploitation, and Miscellaneous with ease.
- **Command Execution**: Execute or simulate commands for tools like `commix`, `nuclei`, `ffuf`, and more.
- **Clipboard Support**: Commands are copied to your clipboard for quick use.
- **Extensible**: Easily add new tools or categories by modifying the code structure.
- **Rich Output**: Clear and visually appealing output using the `rich` library.

## How It Works
The Bug Bounty Tools Assistant is an interactive CLI tool that allows users to select from predefined categories (Recon, Exploitation, Miscellaneous) and tools within those categories. Once a tool is selected, the associated command is displayed, copied to the clipboard, and optionally executed. The tool supports both real execution and simulated execution for testing purposes.

For example:
1. Run the program using `python main.py`.
2. Select a category (e.g., Recon).
3. Choose a tool (e.g., Subdomain Enumeration).
4. The tool's command will be displayed, copied to your clipboard, and optionally executed.

## Code Structure
- **main.py**: Entry point of the application. Displays the main menu and handles user interaction.
- **utils/menu.py**: Contains functions for displaying the main menu and handling tool selection.
- **tools/**: Directory containing modules for different categories (`recon.py`, `exploitation.py`, `miscellaneous.py`).
- **execute_command.py**: Handles the execution or simulation of commands.
- **LICENSE**: License file for the project.

## Future Enhancements
- Add support for additional tools and categories.
- Introduce a web-based GUI for easier accessibility.
- Implement automated updates for tool commands and configurations.
- Add integration with APIs for real-time vulnerability scanning.
